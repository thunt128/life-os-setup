# Life OS — Build Roadmap

A personal life-operating-system web app. Built incrementally, one section at a
time. **Phase 1 is done** — the rest we build together, checking in before each.

## Stack
- **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript** — the app
- **Tailwind CSS** — styling
- **Supabase** — database + auth (single-user, password-protected)
- **Anthropic Claude API** — task classification, summaries, "top 3" answers
- **OpenAI Whisper** — voice → text
- **Telegram bot** (Vercel serverless) — capture notes/photos on the go
- **Vercel** — hosting

## Phases

### ✅ Phase 1 — Foundation (DONE)
- Tailwind set up
- The **Operator dashboard shell** with every panel, using mock data
- The **Supabase schema** (`supabase/schema.sql`)
- This roadmap + `.env.local.example`

> Right now the dashboard shows hard-coded sample data so you can see and feel
> the interface. The next phases make it real.

### ✅ Phase 2 — Database + Auth (live data) (DONE)
1. Create a free Supabase project. *(your step — see README)*
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. *(your step)*
3. ✅ Password-protected login (Supabase Auth) — `app/login/page.tsx`.
4. ✅ Live Supabase queries replace the mock data in `app/page.tsx` for
   Key Tasks, Daily Habits, CRM Kanban, Brain categories, Goals,
   Nutrition, and the Journal entry.
5. ✅ Tasks, habits, goals, and meals save when you add or check them.

> Still on sample data: **Finance Pulse** (the `finance` table is a flat
> label/amount ledger that needs a design pass) and the **Calendar**
> (no calendar table yet). Both are clearly marked in `app/page.tsx`.

### Phase 3 — AI features (Claude)
- Classify a new task into a category + priority.
- Summarize a journal transcript.
- Estimate calories/protein from a meal description or photo.
- Answer "what are the top 3 things I should do right now?" from your task rows.
  (This is the bottom **Ask** bar — currently a stub.)

### Phase 4 — Voice capture (Telegram + Whisper)
- A Vercel serverless function as a Telegram bot webhook.
- Voice note → Whisper transcribes → Claude classifies → row saved → bot confirms.
- Also handles text messages and meal photos.

### Phase 5 — Polish + deploy
- Make it a mobile-installable PWA.
- Deploy to Vercel, connect the GitHub repo for auto-deploys.
